## This repo is a fork of VLMEvalKit to test our FineBench Dataset

This is a temporary fix until we make a pull request to the official repo.

### Run FineBench

1. Install vlmeval kit following the file ***Official_README.md*** file
2. Download the dataset frames from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/FINEBENCH/FineBench)
3. Update the file ***finebench_config.json*** with the path to the dataset and the model you want you run
4. Run `bash run_finebench.sh`
